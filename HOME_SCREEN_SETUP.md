2. Create a new project or select existing
3. Enable **Maps SDK for Android** API
4. Create API key in **Credentials**

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install react-native-maps @react-native-community/geolocation
```

### 3. Android Configuration

The following files have been updated:
- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Added location permissions and API key
- `android/app/build.gradle` - Added Google Play Services dependencies

### 4. Rebuild the App

```

## Backend API Integration

### Required Endpoints
- `GET /booths/nearby/radius` - Get booths within radius
- `GET /booths/available` - Fallback for available booths
- `GET /items` - Get menu items for ordering

### API Response Format
The HomeScreen expects booth data with coordinates:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "booths": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "boothType": "A",
        "status": "available",
